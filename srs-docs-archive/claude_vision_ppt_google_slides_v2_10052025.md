## SLIDE 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**[Slide number: 1/8]**

### Executive Summary

• We're actively exploring Claude for the Shield project and seeing **promising results**.

• We built a fully working CIAM-UI component in a sandbox environment — turning **weeks or months of work into hours and days**.

• We're now evaluating how this generated code could fit into Shield's production release.

• We're gaining real insight into how Agentic AI can **speed development, boost efficiency, and reshape** how we build software.

• This is more than a new tool — it **reshapes how the SDLC and toolchains evolve**.

• During today's presentation, we will introduce Claude Code and how its open source ecosystem is evolving to dramatically change the way we build and deliver software.

## SLIDE 3: WHAT IS CLAUDE CODE

**[Slide number: 2/8]**

### What is Claude Code

**AI Patterns**
_Developers are using AI in different ways for code generation and workflow tasks:_

• Inline Code Completion
• Basic prompting (e.g., with Ally AI)
• Creating and running workflows of predefined steps (e.g., Automating MR Reviews)
• **Agent(ic) Prompting** - goal + tools + freedom — to plan and execute steps that are not predefined

**How is Claude Different**

• Claude's power lies in the **Agentic Prompting technique** as it decides on its own the next set of steps based on the situation

• Claude is optimized to **design systems, analyze code, plan changes and write or debug** with greater accuracy and speed

• Claude can simulate workflow and agent-like behavior using its own reasoning process. This is where your prompt matters

• Claude's coding style exhibits **human-like behavior**... e.g., when it runs into tricky situations, it may decide to:

- Turn on verbose logs
- Add debug logs temporarily to detect the issue
- Create a utility to help debug

• Claude acts as a **pair programmer** and may ask you to take action (e.g., running a functional test, and copying a log from the console it may not have access to)

## SLIDE 5: LEARNINGS FROM USING CLAUDE ON SHIELD

**[Slide number: 4/8]**

### Learnings from using Claude on Shield

**Agentic Power**
Claude can interact with external services, analyze outputs, and iteratively improve code implementations.

**Shift in Paradigm**
Moves from "hand coding & basic prompting" to collaborative, context-driven development.

**Developer Empowerment:**
• Human-like pair programming assist
• Brainstorming support with intelligent exploratory feedback loop
• Lowers cognitive load for new tech exploration
• Reduces barriers to entry — progress is faster and more fluid
• **Compresses weeks of work into days**
• Potential to create production-grade code
• Makes prototyping rapid and easy

**Quality & Control:**
• Developers still need to understand and validate code
• Regression testing remains critical
• Claude can help generate and run regression suites, but will need to go beyond vibe prompting for more autonomous function

## SLIDE 6: A PARADIGM SHIFT

**[Slide number: 5/8]**

### A Paradigm Shift

The industry is evolving from isolated, prompt-based code generation to fully agentic models that understand development context and autonomously deliver software that is adaptive, intelligent, and continuously evolving.

**Why it matters**

• Agentic AI is transforming **every phase of the SDLC** — from requirements gathering to design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance

• Claude Code is enabling a shift where AI becomes **increasingly autonomous** in building and evolving software

• New patterns are emerging that enable us to steer AI toward **deterministic and governed autonomy**

• This requires a **fundamental shift** in how people approach software development

• The change is as much **cultural and process-driven** as it is technological

• There is very rapid evolution in Claude's open-source ecosystem that enables it to be **infused across toolchains and pipelines**

**[Add colored box at bottom]**

> **Bottom line:** This isn't just a tool upgrade — it's a redefinition of how we build and deliver software

## SLIDE 7: VISION - CONTINUOUS INTELLIGENCE PIPELINE

**[Slide number: 6/8]**

### Vision: Continuous Intelligence Pipeline

**A next-generation development model where:**
• Intelligence is continuous, not episodic
• AI agents plan, execute, and learn, within governed workflows
• Humans steer, AI accelerates
• Standardized hooks and integrations keep outcomes predictable
• Each cycle learns and improves the next

**[Insert Infinity Diagram Visualization]**

**Visual Instructions for Google Slides:**

1. Create an infinity symbol (∞) using curved arrows or shapes
2. Add labels along the path: Plan → Design → Build → Test → Deploy → Learn → (loops back)
3. Use gradient colors (cyan to blue)
4. Add a dashed border around the entire diagram
5. Add text at bottom: "Governed by Policy, Guided by People"
6. Background: Dark gradient (navy to black)

**Caption:**
_Continuous Intelligence Pipeline = AI infused into every phase of delivery — adaptive, governed, and learning by design._

## SLIDE 8: CLAUDE'S EVOLVING ARCHITECTURE

**[Slide number: 7/8]**

### Claude's Evolving Architecture

_The Building Blocks of Agentic AI_

Claude's open architecture is designed for governed autonomy, integration flexibility, and speed of iteration.

| **Component**          | **Purpose**                                                                   | **Use Example**                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow**           | Defines how prompts and responses move through a sequence                     | Automated code review workflow                                            |
| **Agent**              | The "brain" that plans and decides how to achieve a goal                      | Autonomous bug fixing agent                                               |
| **Commands**           | Frequently used workflows and prompts that provide deterministic instructions | Project-specific build commands                                           |
| **CLAUDE.md**          | Automatically pulled into Claude context for guidelines and setup             | 1. Naming conventions<br>2. Coding patterns<br>3. Security considerations |
| **Hooks**              | Deterministic control over Claude's behavior at lifecycle stages              | Auto-deploy after code modification                                       |
| **MCP + Integrations** | Standard interfaces for Claude to connect with data, tools, and systems       | GitLab, CI/CD pipeline integration                                        |

**Claude infusion goes beyond the iterative development phase:**

1. **Post-Commit Activities:**
   • Automatically create and update merge requests from issue descriptions
   • Run and fix performance test, regression test and security scans directly in branches

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**
   • GitLab can trigger Claude when @claude is used in issues, MRs, or review threads
