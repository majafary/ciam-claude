# MFA Timer Fix - Complete Solution

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Infinite Re-renders âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: The polling useEffect had problematic dependencies that changed on every render:
- `timeLeft` was included in the dependency but got updated inside the polling loop
- This created an infinite cycle: polling updates `timeLeft` â†’ effect re-runs â†’ clears interval â†’ starts new interval

**Solution**:
- Used `useCallback` to create stable polling function that doesn't recreate on every render
- Separated `backendTimeLeft` state for backend synchronization from UI `timeLeft`
- Used `useRef` to track interval and prevent multiple intervals running
- Added transaction ID tracking to prevent restarting polling for same transaction

### Issue 2: Timer State Conflicts âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Timer logic was inconsistent between OTP and Push modes:
- Timer progress calculation was incorrect for backend timing
- State updates conflicted between local countdown and backend polling

**Solution**:
- Unified timer system that properly syncs with backend `expiresAt` timestamp
- Fixed progress bar calculation to correctly show time remaining
- Proper cleanup of intervals when transactions change or expire

### Issue 3: Transaction State Propagation âœ… VERIFIED
**Problem**: Transaction objects weren't properly triggering polling startup

**Solution**:
- Verified transaction flows from useMfa â†’ CiamLoginComponent â†’ MfaMethodSelectionDialog
- All prop passing is correct and transaction state is properly managed

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Stable Polling with useCallback
```typescript
// OLD: Recreated on every render, causing infinite loops
useEffect(() => {
  if (isPushWaiting && transaction?.transactionId) {
    const interval = setInterval(async () => {
      // Updates timeLeft, triggering effect re-run
    }, 1000);
  }
}, [isPushWaiting, transaction?.transactionId, timeLeft]); // timeLeft dependency problem

// NEW: Stable function, controlled interval management
const startPolling = useCallback(async (transactionId: string) => {
  // Stable polling logic
}, [onCheckStatus, onPushVerify]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isPushWaiting && transaction?.transactionId && !intervalRef.current) {
    startPolling(transaction.transactionId);
  }
}, [isPushWaiting, transaction?.transactionId, startPolling]);
```

### 2. Proper Interval Management
```typescript
// Use refs to track interval state
const intervalRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
const lastTransactionIdRef = useRef<string | null>(null);

// Clear intervals properly when transaction changes
if (intervalRef.current) {
  clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  intervalRef.current = null;
}
```

### 3. Backend Timer Synchronization
```typescript
// Sync timer with backend expiresAt timestamp
if (data.expiresAt) {
  const expiryTime = new Date(data.expiresAt).getTime();
  const currentTime = new Date().getTime();
  const timeRemainingMs = expiryTime - currentTime;
  const timeRemainingSec = Math.max(0, Math.ceil(timeRemainingMs / 1000));

  setBackendTimeLeft(timeRemainingSec);
  setTimeLeft(timeRemainingSec);
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For mfauser (auto-approve test user):
1. âœ… Login with mfauser/password
2. âœ… Select Push method
3. âœ… Timer starts immediately and counts down from 10 seconds
4. âœ… Progress bar moves smoothly
5. âœ… Auto-approval occurs after ~5 seconds with selectedNumber from polling
6. âœ… Dialog closes, user authenticated

### For pushexpired (timeout test user):
1. âœ… Login with pushexpired/password
2. âœ… Select Push method
3. âœ… Timer counts down from 10 seconds
4. âœ… At 0 seconds, shows "Push notification expired" with fallback options
5. âœ… User can "Try Push Again" or "Use OTP Instead"

### For pushfail (rejection test user):
1. âœ… Login with pushfail/password
2. âœ… Select Push method
3. âœ… Timer counts down normally
4. âœ… Auto-rejection occurs after ~7 seconds
5. âœ… Shows rejection error with "Try Push Again" or "Use OTP Instead" options

## Testing Verification Points

1. **No Infinite Re-renders**: Console should show clean transaction flow without repeated "ðŸ”„ Polling effect check"
2. **Timer Movement**: "Time remaining" should count down: 0:10 â†’ 0:09 â†’ 0:08, etc.
3. **Progress Bar**: Linear progress bar should visually advance from left to right
4. **Backend Sync**: Timer should be accurate to backend expiry time (Â±1 second)
5. **Cleanup**: No memory leaks - intervals should be cleared when dialog closes
6. **State Transitions**: Clean state transitions without conflicts between local/backend state

## Files Modified

1. **MfaMethodSelectionDialog.tsx**: Complete timer system rewrite with stable polling
2. **AuthService.ts**: Already correctly implemented (verified)
3. **useMfa.ts**: Already correctly implemented (verified)
4. **CiamLoginComponent.tsx**: Already correctly implemented (verified)

## Ready for Testing

The solution has been thoroughly analyzed and implemented. All critical issues have been addressed:
- âœ… Infinite re-render loop fixed
- âœ… Timer system completely rewritten with stable polling
- âœ… Backend synchronization implemented
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
- âœ… State management conflicts resolved

The MFA flow should now work correctly for all test users with proper timer countdown animation.
